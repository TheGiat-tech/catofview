# Top 5 Cat Toys Every Cat Needs

Every cat deserves engaging toys that stimulate both mind and body. Here are our top recommendations!

## 1. Interactive Feather Wand

The classic feather wand never goes out of style. It's perfect for:
- Building trust with your cat
- Providing exercise
- Satisfying hunting instincts

### Why We Love It

This toy mimics the movement of prey, triggering your cat's natural hunting behaviors. It's an excellent way to bond with your pet while keeping them active.

## 2. Laser Pointer

A laser pointer provides endless entertainment! Just remember to:

```python
def laser_play_time(minutes):
    """Calculate optimal laser play duration"""
    if minutes > 15:
        return "Too long - cat might get frustrated"
    elif minutes < 5:
        return "Too short - increase play time"
    else:
        return "Perfect duration!"

print(laser_play_time(10))  # Perfect duration!
```

**Important**: Always end laser play by allowing your cat to "catch" a physical toy!

## 3. Puzzle Feeders

These toys combine play with feeding:
- Slow down fast eaters
- Provide mental stimulation  
- Prevent boredom

## 4. Catnip Mice

Small, soft, and irresistible! Most cats go crazy for catnip toys.

## 5. Tunnel Systems

Cats love to hide and pounce. A good tunnel provides:
- Security and comfort
- Exercise opportunities
- Entertainment value
